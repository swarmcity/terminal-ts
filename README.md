# Terminal implementation in TS

## At its core Swarm City is a blockchain based marketplace with a built in reputation system.
### Swarm City uses blockchain technology and smart contracts to allow people to communicate and transact value, and earn contextual reputation.

**The blockchain provides transparency, so users can safely interact with people they donâ€™t know, while keeping their private information to themselves. Smart contracts make sure interactions go as planned, and generate marketplace specific reputation for successful deals.**
